# Culinary Chronicles
## Introduction:
We are creating a recipe sharing website. A recipe sharing website is a platform that enables users to share, search, 
and discover new recipes. It provides a digital space for people to exchange culinary ideas and explore different cuisines. 
A recipe sharing website will allow users to upload their own recipes and browse through a variety of recipes.

## Problem Statement:
Despite the popularity of cooking shows and food blogs, many people still struggle to find and create new and exciting 
dishes to add to their repertoire. Our website will be a solution to this disorganized problem that users have. The

look for quick, easy, and delicious recipes that they can rely on.
